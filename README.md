# EC-DT
Exact Convertible Decision Tree
EC-DT constructs the rule sets layer-wise based on the activation of the hidden nodes to find an exact representation of ANNs in tree forms.
The algorithm is designed to be complete and sound; that is, it preserves 100% performance of ANNs by maintaining the generalizability of the network while providing an interpretable representation.
